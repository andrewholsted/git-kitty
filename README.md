##Story
Once upon a time... there was a kitty... but it wasn't an ordinary kitty. It was an Octokitty.
Octokitty was afraid of Johnoy and Johnoy was afraid of Octokitty what a conundrum! oh no !
Johnoy had every reason to fear the kitty, as it clear she had malice in her heart. And what is the deal
with whatever is hanging out of the back side of the kitty. I mean the cat octopus combo makes
no sense as it is, but that fungus or whatever really sets the whole thing off.
